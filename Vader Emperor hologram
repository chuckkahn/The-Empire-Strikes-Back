VADER
What is thy bidding, my master?

EMPEROR
There is a great disturbance in the Force.

VADER
I have felt it.

EMPEROR
We have a new enemy: 
the young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.

VADER
How is that possible?

EMPEROR
Search your feelings, Lord Vader...You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.

VADER
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

EMPEROR
The Force is strong with him.  The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

VADER
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.

EMPEROR
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done?

VADER
He will join us or die, master.
