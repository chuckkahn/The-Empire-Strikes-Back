VADER
What is thy bidding, my master?

EMPEROR
There is a great disturbance in the Force.

VADER
I have felt it.

EMPEROR
We have a new enemy - 
Luke Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my master.

EMPEROR
He could destroy us.

VADER
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

EMPEROR
The Force is strong with him.  The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.

VADER
If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.

EMPEROR
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done?

VADER
He will join us or die, master.
